You are a professional conlinguist, that is you invent new constructed languages with original vocabulary, grammar, syntax in innovative ways. For that task you are then investigating more than simply the english or indoeuropean languages but take inspiration from any kind of language of any language family and writing system or diacritics. You are required to make a complete new language, you must provide:
1. Alphabet: a list of unicode characters of any kind can also be combinations of characters to make unique graphemes
2. Vocabulary: list all grammatical functions (including verbs, nouns, articles, adjectives, suffixes, affixes, pronouns, or arbitrary new funky ones) of the conlang and for each of them give the morphosyntaxic rules for making a word of that role, expressed as a regular expression.
3. Grammar: you will have to choose a specific word order, which grammatical functions  are in which place in a sentence, which are always present, never present or sometimes present in a sentence using a formal grammar.
4. Phonetics: a way to deduce from any given word/morpheme that is from its combination of symbols/graphemes, a specifc pronunciation (that you will define using International Phonetic Alphabet), you must have a conversion rule for most characters of the alphabet and it has to use the IPA

Those three tasks shall be done in a specific YAML format:
language:
 name: "Name" #Name of the language

word_roles: #the list of the language word roles
	role_1: "regex1" #can use any unicode regex
	role_2: "regex2"
	...
	
grammar_rules:
	S: ... #start symbol do not loop onto S
	...
	... : [@role_n] #terminal symbols with @roles from word_roles

phonetic_rules:
	- pattern: "regex1" #unicode regex
	  replace: "ipa1" #ipa only can contain multiple characters
	- pattern: "regex2"
	  replace: "ipa2"

Here is an example of the format being used:
language:
  name: "MyConlang"

word_roles:
  noun: "([bdfgklmnprst][aeiou][bdgklmnprst])"  
  verb: "([ptkmn][aeiou][tdkmn])"  
  decorator: "(:\\))|(x\\))"
  pronoun: "(i|u|e|o)"  
  conjunction: "(na|ka|ta)"  

grammar_rules:
  S: ["NP VP @decorator", "NS @conjunction NS"]
  NS: ["NP VP"]
  NP: ["the @noun", "@pronoun"]  
  VP: ["@verb", "@verb NP"]

phonetic_rules:
    - pattern: "ch"  
      replace: "tʃ"  
    - pattern: "sh"  
      replace: "ʃ"  
    - pattern: "n(?=[kg])"  
      replace: "ŋ"  
    - pattern: "c"  
      replace: "k"  
    - pattern: "h(?<=t)"  
      replace: ""  
    - pattern: "e(?=[b-df-hj-np-tv-z])"  
      replace: "ɛ"

Now create me a new original language, use a small character set and a small set of grammar rules.
